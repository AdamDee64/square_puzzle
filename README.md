Rules:<br>
There is a blank grid with a series of numbers to the left of each row and above each column.<br>
Each number corresponds to the number of blue tiles on the grid.<br>
You have to guess which tiles are blue with logic and hints in the form of numbers<br>
The numbers appear in order of how the blue tiles appear in it's corresponding column or row, and in what quantity. <br>

for example, if to the left of a row, you see the numbers 1, 3, 2  that means in that row there will be 1, 3 and 2 blue tiles<br>
Each grouping will be separated by a blank tile.<br>

You must use logic to figure out where the blue tiles are<br>

basic functionality:<br>
Left clicking locks in your guess to where the blue tile should be.<br>
If it is wrong, it will turn red and you can right-click to change it <br>
Right clicking cycles through grey (blue tile isn't there), light blue (blue tile possible) or blank<br>
pressing R will reset a new randomized game<br>

features:<br>
Can set the number of rows and columns, it doesn't have to be a square, and the puzzle will scale for that size.<br>
Recommended max 10X10<br>
